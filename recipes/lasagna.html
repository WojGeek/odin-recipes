        <li>Onion and garlic</li>
        <p>
            An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </p>
        
        <li>Tomato products</li>
        <p>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <p>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <p>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
